Execution same sceanrios for different config(s) option(s)
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently script uses sceanrios mentioned for value:
"RALLY_SCENARIOS". It's hardcoded for now.
So if you need to change it, please update it manually.

The script gets 3 optional params:
 - min (default == 4)
 - max (default == 8)
 - step (default == 1)

These options used for changing parameter of 'num_engine_workers'
in heat config file.

The main logic is follow:
 - Copy this script in folder with necessary sceanrios or use
   correct pathes on the scenarios
 - Execute command `bash test_script.sh` with optional paramaters
   (if it's necessary), otrwise will be used default values
 - Script will set Convergence is True (currently it's commented in function
   `set_up_convergence` and  will be used default Heat engine)
 - Then all heat-engine and heat-api processes will be restarted with command
   `service *** restart`
 - New value of the `num_engine_workers` will be set and heat-engine
   will be restarted again to apply new config.
 - Mentioned Rally will be executed and all results will be stored to files:
   with name: <scenario-name>-<current value of the 'num_engine_workers'>.
   Note: all these files will be stored in directory ``results/new_default/``.
   It's also hardcoded for now.
 - Then whole cycle will repeat with new value of `num_engine_workers`
